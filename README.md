Motivation

Motivated by close ties to my local fire departments, notably through my husband's career as a firefighter, I couldn't help but notice a recurring trend: during specific periods, his involvement in responding to structure fires appeared to increase. Often, he'd recount the intense heat or return home reeking the of smoke, but the causes were more often than not, unknown. Fires are a significant threat to public safety, and understanding the patterns and trends associated with structure fire incidents is crucial for effective prevention strategies. With close ties to local fire departments in Kentucky, performing an analysis on fires in Nashville stems from a deep concern for community safety and a desire to make a positive impact.  I explored the following:

Questions:
* Do certain fire causes occur mostly in one season?
* How do Nashville zip code demographics influence structure fire volume? * How does population, income, owner/renter occupancy, and residence type influence the frequency of structure fires in Nashville? 

Normalizing the Data

The dataset I selected mainly consisted of years from 1970 through 2021. I selected the most recent five years of data, 2017-2021. I then cleaned the data and narrowed down to the information that I wanted to use for my analysis. My initial approach was to use the data for Nashville, TN and then compare the difference/ correlation between zip codes, but I realized that it would be more interesting to compare it to the entire state of Tennessee. As for zip code demographics, it was much easier for me to pick and choose which statistics I was needing from different surveys and utilize MS Excel for organization. 

Problems and Hurdles

With this analysis containing both public and personal information, it will be difficult to plot fire locations on a map. Protecting citizen’s identities and addresses is top priority while simultaneously providing a deep enough analysis. I initially wanted to see if there were properties experiencing several fires by the same cause, but protecting the persons’ information was crucial.




Technologies Used
1. Python / Pandas - for exploration, normalizing and aggregation of the dataset
2. Tableau - for creating interactive dashboard
3. Git - for version control
4. MS Excel- for quick data collecting
5. Canva – to create the visually appealing motivation and tips pages


Data Sources

To answer the above questions, I used the following sources to collect datasets for my analysis
1. Structure Fire information (Nashville, TN and Tennessee) Annual NFIRS Public Data | FEMA.gov  
2. Nashville zipcodes/Neighborhoods Nashville Area Zip Codes (nashvillesmls.com)
3. S0101: Population - Census Bureau Table
4. S1902: MEAN INCOME IN THE PAST 12 ... - Census Bureau Table
5. S1101: HOUSEHOLDS AND FAMILIES - Census Bureau Table

Conclusion

The data analysis shows the correlation between various structure fire causes and time of year in Tennessee and Nashville. According to the analysis performed, there is a structure fire season (fall) and the causes change volume with the season and zip code. With the findings of the analysis, valuable insights will be provided for fire departments and the community in Nashville and Tennessee.
